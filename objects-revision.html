        <strong>Objects review</strong>
        <p>and revison</p>
        <p>objects are used to store diffrent data of functions in a orginised way. they are also used to hold data for for stuffl like name tags of lots of people. you could make a constructor that sets the propertys of an object easly for each person</p>

        // here is a basic object in litaral notation

         // You dont have to contuctor is like using a template, You can make your own if you want to. This is done by making a function that will define the properties you want in an object. this is good for recording repeditive infomation like name and age for students in a classroom
